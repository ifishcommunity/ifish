The percentages of Saloptia powelli (ID #36, Epinephelidae) in 2016, n = 58

Small mature (>= 23cm, < 30cm): 3%
Large mature (>= 30cm): 97%
Mega spawner (>= 33cm): 91% (subset of large mature fish)
Spawning Potential Ratio: 70%
 
At least 90% of the fish in the catch are mature specimens that have spawned at least
once before they were caught. The fishery does not depend on immature size classes
for this species and is considered safe for this indicator. This fishery will not be
causing overfishing through over harvesting of juveniles for this species. Risk level
is low.

The trade limit is significantly higher than length at first maturity.  This means
that the trade puts a premium on fish that have spawned at least once. The trade does
not cause any concern of recruitment overfishing for this species. Risk level is low.

The majority of the catch consists of size classes around or above the optimum
harvest size. This means that the impact of the fishery is minimized for this
species. Potentially higher yields of this species could be achieved by catching them
at somewhat smaller size, although capture of smaller specimen may take place already
in other fisheries. Risk level is low.

More than 30% of the catch consists of mega spawners which indicates that this fish
population is in good health unless large amounts of much smaller fish from the same
population are caught by other fisheries. Risk level is low.
 
Mortality caused by fishing is at or below a level equal to half the natural rate of
mortality. This means that impact of fishing is minimized and this fishery is
currently probably operating at a sustainable level of effort. Risk level is low.
 
SPR is more than 40%. The stock is probably not over exploited, and the risk that the
fishery will cause further stock decline is small. Risk level is low.

for this species and is considered safe for this indicator. This fishery will not be
causing overfishing through over harvesting of juveniles for this species. Risk level
is low.

The trade limit is about the same as the length at first maturity.  This means that
the trade puts a premium on fish that have spawned at least once, which improves
sustainability of the fishery. Risk level is medium.

The majority of the catch consists of size classes around or above the optimum
harvest size. This means that the impact of the fishery is minimized for this
species. Potentially higher yields of this species could be achieved by catching them
at somewhat smaller size, although capture of smaller specimen may take place already
in other fisheries. Risk level is low.

More than 30% of the catch consists of mega spawners which indicates that this fish
population is in good health unless large amounts of much smaller fish from the same
population are caught by other fisheries. Risk level is low.
 
Mortality caused by fishing is at or below a level equal to half the natural rate of
mortality. This means that impact of fishing is minimized and this fishery is
currently probably operating at a sustainable level of effort. Risk level is low.
 
SPR is more than 40%. The stock is probably not over exploited, and the risk that the
fishery will cause further stock decline is small. Risk level is low.

Between 10% and 20% of the fish in the catch are juveniles that have not yet

harvesting of juveniles, but the fishery needs to be monitored closely for any
further increase in this indicator and incentives need to be geared towards targeting
larger fish. Risk level is medium.

The trade limit is significantly lower than the length at first maturity.  This means
that the trade encourages capture of immature fish, which impairs sustainability.
Risk level is high.

The vast majority of the fish in the catch have not yet achieved their growth
potential. The harvest of small fish promotes growth overfishing and the size
distribution for this species indicates that over exploitation through growth
overfishing may already be happening. Risk level is high.

Less than 20% of the catch comprises of mega spawners.  This indicates that the
population may be severely affected by the fishery, and that there is a substantial
risk of recruitment overfishing through over harvesting of the mega spawners, unless
large numbers of mega spawners would be surviving at other habitats. There is no
reason to assume that this is the case and therefore a reduction of fishing effort
may be necessary in this fishery. Risk level is high.
 
Mortality caused by fishing is lower than the natural rate of mortality but more than
half of natural mortality. This means that impact of fishing is considerable and
trends in various indicators need to be watched carefully while any increase in
fishing effort needs to be prevented. Risk level is medium.
 
SPR is between 25% and 40%. The stock is heavily exploited, and there is some risk
that the fishery will cause further decline of the stock. Risk level is medium.

At least 90% of the fish in the catch are mature specimens that have spawned at least
once before they were caught. The fishery does not depend on immature size classes
for this species and is considered safe for this indicator. This fishery will not be
causing overfishing through over harvesting of juveniles for this species. Risk level
is low.

The trade limit is significantly higher than length at first maturity.  This means
that the trade puts a premium on fish that have spawned at least once. The trade does
not cause any concern of recruitment overfishing for this species. Risk level is low.

The majority of the catch consists of size classes around or above the optimum
harvest size. This means that the impact of the fishery is minimized for this
species. Potentially higher yields of this species could be achieved by catching them
at somewhat smaller size, although capture of smaller specimen may take place already
in other fisheries. Risk level is low.

More than 30% of the catch consists of mega spawners which indicates that this fish
population is in good health unless large amounts of much smaller fish from the same
population are caught by other fisheries. Risk level is low.
 
Mortality caused by fishing is at or below a level equal to half the natural rate of
mortality. This means that impact of fishing is minimized and this fishery is
currently probably operating at a sustainable level of effort. Risk level is low.

Large mature (>= 33cm): 71%
Mega spawner (>= 36.3cm): 44% (subset of large mature fish)
Spawning Potential Ratio: 25%
 
At least 90% of the fish in the catch are mature specimens that have spawned at least
once before they were caught. The fishery does not depend on immature size classes
for this species and is considered safe for this indicator. This fishery will not be
causing overfishing through over harvesting of juveniles for this species. Risk level
is low.

The trade limit is significantly higher than length at first maturity.  This means
that the trade puts a premium on fish that have spawned at least once. The trade does
not cause any concern of recruitment overfishing for this species. Risk level is low.

The majority of the catch consists of size classes around or above the optimum
harvest size. This means that the impact of the fishery is minimized for this
species. Potentially higher yields of this species could be achieved by catching them
at somewhat smaller size, although capture of smaller specimen may take place already
in other fisheries. Risk level is low.

More than 30% of the catch consists of mega spawners which indicates that this fish
population is in good health unless large amounts of much smaller fish from the same
population are caught by other fisheries. Risk level is low.
 
Mortality caused by fishing is greater than or equal to the natural rate of
mortality. This means that impact of fishing is severe and that fishing is unlikely
to be sustainable at the current level of effort. Risk level is high.
 
SPR is between 25% and 40%. The stock is heavily exploited, and there is some risk
that the fishery will cause further decline of the stock. Risk level is medium.
 
Trends in relative abundance by size group for Variola albimarginata (ID #62,
Epinephelidae), as calculated from linear regressions. The P value indicates the
chance that this calculated trend is merely a result of stochastic variance.
% Immature no trend over recent years, situation stable. P: 0.742
% Large Mature falling over recent years, situation deteriorating. P: 0.458
% Mega Spawner falling over recent years, situation deteriorating. P: 0.522
% SPR rising over recent years, situation improving. P: 0.742
