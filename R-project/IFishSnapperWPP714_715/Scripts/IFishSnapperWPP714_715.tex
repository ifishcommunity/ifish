The percentages of Aphareus rutilans (ID #1, Lutjanidae) in 2016, n = 10,340

Large mature (>= 88cm): 7%

Spawning Potential Ratio: 3%
 
Between 30% and 50% of the fish in the catch are immature and have not had a chance
to reproduce before capture. The fishery is in immediate danger of overfishing
through overharvesting of juveniles, if fishing pressure is high.  Catching small and
immature fish needs to be actively avoided and a limit on overall fishing pressure is
warranted. Risk level is high.

The trade limit is significantly lower than the length at first maturity.  This means
that the trade encourages capture of immature fish, which impairs sustainability.
Risk level is high.

The vast majority of the fish in the catch have not yet achieved their growth
potential. The harvest of small fish promotes growth overfishing and the size
distribution for this species indicates that over exploitation through growth
overfishing may already be happening. Risk level is high.

Less than 20% of the catch comprises of mega spawners.  This indicates that the
population may be severely affected by the fishery, and that there is a substantial
risk of recruitment overfishing through over harvesting of the mega spawners, unless
large numbers of mega spawners would be surviving at other habitats. There is no
reason to assume that this is the case and therefore a reduction of fishing effort
may be necessary in this fishery. Risk level is high.
 
Mortality caused by fishing is greater than or equal to the natural rate of
mortality. This means that impact of fishing is severe and that fishing is unlikely
to be sustainable at the current level of effort. Risk level is high.
 
SPR is less than 25%. The fishery probably over-exploits the stock, and there is a
substantial risk that the fishery will cause severe decline of the stock if fishing
effort is not reduced. Risk level is high.

Large mature (>= 78cm): 47%

Spawning Potential Ratio: 6%
 
At least 90% of the fish in the catch are mature specimens that have spawned at least
once before they were caught. The fishery does not depend on immature size classes
for this species and is considered safe for this indicator. This fishery will not be
causing overfishing through over harvesting of juveniles for this species. Risk level
is low.

The trade limit is significantly lower than the length at first maturity.  This means
that the trade encourages capture of immature fish, which impairs sustainability.
Risk level is high.

The bulk of the catch includes age groups that have just matured and are about to
achieve their full growth potential. This indicates that the fishery is probably at
least being fully exploited. Risk level is medium.

Less than 20% of the catch comprises of mega spawners.  This indicates that the
population may be severely affected by the fishery, and that there is a substantial

The majority of the fish in the catch have not had a chance to reproduce before
capture. This fishery is most likely overfished already if fishing mortality is high
for all size classes in the population. An immediate shift away from targeting
juvenile fish and a reduction in overall fishing pressure is essential to prevent
collapse of the stock. Risk level is high.

distribution for this species indicates that over exploitation through growth
overfishing may already be happening. Risk level is high.

Less than 20% of the catch comprises of mega spawners.  This indicates that the
population may be severely affected by the fishery, and that there is a substantial
risk of recruitment overfishing through over harvesting of the mega spawners, unless
large numbers of mega spawners would be surviving at other habitats. There is no
reason to assume that this is the case and therefore a reduction of fishing effort
may be necessary in this fishery. Risk level is high.
 
Mortality caused by fishing is greater than or equal to the natural rate of
mortality. This means that impact of fishing is severe and that fishing is unlikely
to be sustainable at the current level of effort. Risk level is high.
 
SPR is less than 25%. The fishery probably over-exploits the stock, and there is a
substantial risk that the fishery will cause severe decline of the stock if fishing
effort is not reduced. Risk level is high.

At least 90% of the fish in the catch are mature specimens that have spawned at least
once before they were caught. The fishery does not depend on immature size classes
for this species and is considered safe for this indicator. This fishery will not be
causing overfishing through over harvesting of juveniles for this species. Risk level
is low.

The trade limit is significantly lower than the length at first maturity.  This means
that the trade encourages capture of immature fish, which impairs sustainability.
Risk level is high.

The majority of the catch consists of size classes around or above the optimum
harvest size. This means that the impact of the fishery is minimized for this
species. Potentially higher yields of this species could be achieved by catching them
at somewhat smaller size, although capture of smaller specimen may take place already
in other fisheries. Risk level is low.

More than 30% of the catch consists of mega spawners which indicates that this fish
population is in good health unless large amounts of much smaller fish from the same
population are caught by other fisheries. Risk level is low.
 
Mortality caused by fishing is at or below a level equal to half the natural rate of
mortality. This means that impact of fishing is minimized and this fishery is
currently probably operating at a sustainable level of effort. Risk level is low.

Between 10% and 20% of the fish in the catch are juveniles that have not yet
reproduced. There is no immediate concern in terms of overfishing through over
harvesting of juveniles, but the fishery needs to be monitored closely for any
further increase in this indicator and incentives need to be geared towards targeting
larger fish. Risk level is medium.

The trade limit is significantly lower than the length at first maturity.  This means
that the trade encourages capture of immature fish, which impairs sustainability.
Risk level is high.

The bulk of the catch includes age groups that have just matured and are about to
achieve their full growth potential. This indicates that the fishery is probably at
least being fully exploited. Risk level is medium.

The percentage of mega spawners is between 20 and 30%.  There is no immediate reason
for concern, though fishing pressure may be significantly reducing the percentage of
mega-spawners, which may negatively affect the reproductive output of this
population. Risk level is medium.
 
Mortality caused by fishing is greater than or equal to the natural rate of
mortality. This means that impact of fishing is severe and that fishing is unlikely
to be sustainable at the current level of effort. Risk level is high.
 
SPR is between 25% and 40%. The stock is heavily exploited, and there is some risk
that the fishery will cause further decline of the stock. Risk level is medium.

At least 90% of the fish in the catch are mature specimens that have spawned at least
once before they were caught. The fishery does not depend on immature size classes
for this species and is considered safe for this indicator. This fishery will not be
causing overfishing through over harvesting of juveniles for this species. Risk level
is low.

The trade limit is significantly lower than the length at first maturity.  This means
that the trade encourages capture of immature fish, which impairs sustainability.
Risk level is high.

The majority of the catch consists of size classes around or above the optimum
harvest size. This means that the impact of the fishery is minimized for this
species. Potentially higher yields of this species could be achieved by catching them
at somewhat smaller size, although capture of smaller specimen may take place already
in other fisheries. Risk level is low.

More than 30% of the catch consists of mega spawners which indicates that this fish
population is in good health unless large amounts of much smaller fish from the same
population are caught by other fisheries. Risk level is low.
 
Mortality caused by fishing is at or below a level equal to half the natural rate of
mortality. This means that impact of fishing is minimized and this fishery is
currently probably operating at a sustainable level of effort. Risk level is low.
 
SPR is more than 40%. The stock is probably not over exploited, and the risk that the
fishery will cause further stock decline is small. Risk level is low.

risk of recruitment overfishing through over harvesting of the mega spawners, unless
large numbers of mega spawners would be surviving at other habitats. There is no
reason to assume that this is the case and therefore a reduction of fishing effort
may be necessary in this fishery. Risk level is high.
 
Mortality caused by fishing is greater than or equal to the natural rate of
mortality. This means that impact of fishing is severe and that fishing is unlikely
to be sustainable at the current level of effort. Risk level is high.
 
SPR is less than 25%. The fishery probably over-exploits the stock, and there is a
substantial risk that the fishery will cause severe decline of the stock if fishing
effort is not reduced. Risk level is high.

At least 90% of the fish in the catch are mature specimens that have spawned at least
once before they were caught. The fishery does not depend on immature size classes
for this species and is considered safe for this indicator. This fishery will not be
causing overfishing through over harvesting of juveniles for this species. Risk level
is low.

The trade limit is significantly higher than length at first maturity.  This means
that the trade puts a premium on fish that have spawned at least once. The trade does
not cause any concern of recruitment overfishing for this species. Risk level is low.

The majority of the catch consists of size classes around or above the optimum
harvest size. This means that the impact of the fishery is minimized for this
species. Potentially higher yields of this species could be achieved by catching them
at somewhat smaller size, although capture of smaller specimen may take place already
in other fisheries. Risk level is low.

More than 30% of the catch consists of mega spawners which indicates that this fish
population is in good health unless large amounts of much smaller fish from the same
population are caught by other fisheries. Risk level is low.
 
Mortality caused by fishing is at or below a level equal to half the natural rate of
mortality. This means that impact of fishing is minimized and this fishery is
currently probably operating at a sustainable level of effort. Risk level is low.
 
SPR is more than 40%. The stock is probably not over exploited, and the risk that the
fishery will cause further stock decline is small. Risk level is low.
